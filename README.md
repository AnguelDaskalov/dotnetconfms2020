Demo from July 30 2020 DotNet Conference "The Intersection of Microservices, Domain-Driven Design, &amp; EF Core"

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides much of the strategic design guidance that we can use to determine the boundaries around and interactions between Microservices in our solutions. DDD also follows up with tactical design patterns for your business logic. In this session weâ€™ll take a look at some of these patterns and how EF Core naturally, or with some additional configuration, persists the data that your microservices depend on.

Sessions from the event will be posted somewhere on https://focus.dotnetconf.net/
